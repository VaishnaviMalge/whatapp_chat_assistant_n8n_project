Project Progress and Current Status

- Successfully integrated Twilio WhatsApp with n8n, establishing seamless communication for message triggering.

- Developed a webhook trigger node in n8n to reliably receive and process incoming WhatsApp messages.

- Extracted key information such as commands, file/folder names, and related details from the incoming data.

- Implemented search functionality to locate files and folders, retrieving critical metadata including IDs and MIME types.

- Configured the Twilio node to send automated, context-aware reply messages based on the command execution.

- Built dedicated command execution nodes for folders, demonstrating ability to modularize and extend functionality.

- Showcased adaptability by planning to extend similar command execution for files.

- Encountered a complex challenge in accessing outputs from non-immediate previously executed nodes within n8n workflows.

- Persistently researched and experimented with various approaches, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and resilience.

- Despite efforts, this specific technical hurdle prevented full completion of the project at this stage.
